# Electronic-Voting-Machine

I am proud to share my latest project, an electronic voting machine that I developed as part of my university coursework. The machine allows for voting between four candidates and is designed to be user-friendly and efficient. Through this project, I honed my skills in electronics and programming and gained experience in developing hardware and software that are designed for practical use. I am excited to continue exploring the possibilities of technology in making processes like voting more accessible and efficient.
